One way to do that is to try different values for all of the hyperparemeters it uses, hoping to fine-tune their value to get the best result our of our existing model. This is called hyperparameter optimization, and it's a very common practice in machine learning. A great tool to do this automatically is a grid search, which will try all the possible combinations of hyperparameters you want to try, and return the best one. However, this can be very time consuming, and it's not always possible to try all the possible combinations. This is where Weights and Biases Sweeps comes in handy.\n",

You can use the tf.keras.preprocessing.image.ImageDataGenerator (which you'll find in the code above already) to do this. You could also do the same for the metadata, but it's a little more complicated.\n",

    "5. Change the features used in the metadata model. You can add, remove, or modify the features used. You could also compute new features from the existing ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Improve time needed for inference. You can try to reduce the number of parameters in the model, or use a more efficient CNN architecture to make it more efficient. This is *key* for the model to be used in production, as we expect it to run on thousands of alerts every day.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Be creative! There are an infinite number of ways to improve a model, and we're sure you can come up with something we haven't thought of :)\n",
